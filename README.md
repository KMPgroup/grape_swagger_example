# Grape + Swagger Example

This is an example of an rails app that uses
Grape and Swagger to create a beautifull api in
Rails.

For details read my [blog post](http://bitboxer.de/2014/02/09/grape/) about it.

To start this app:

```bash
bundle
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rails s
```

Now you can play with the api documentation with [this link](http://localhost:3000/apidoc).
